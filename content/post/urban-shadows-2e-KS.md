The Kickstarter for [Urban Shadows 2nd edition](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/urban-shadows-second-edition/?ref=kicktraq) just dropped! I happen to be a big fan of Urban Shadows, a Powered by the Apocalypse game of supernatural politics. I'm going to go through the preview and see what cool new goodies are in store for us!

First, the quick list of changes. I'll go into further details as I explore them in the quickstart!

* revised basic moves, including new versions of **turn to violence** and **let it out** 

- revised playbooks, including rebuilt versions of **The Hunter** and **The Oracle** 
- two brand new playbooks: **The Sworn** (Power) and **The Imp** (Wild) 
- changing Factions to Circles—see below—and adding Circle Status to represent standing
- a new downtime phase of the game focused on player-facing city moves and rumors
- replacing Storms with a new MC-facing faction turn, including new faction moves
- expanded MC tools for generating your city and Circles at the start of play

* City hubs

  ## First Impressions

  

* This art is _gorgeous_.

* The *mortal* faction has been renamed to **mortalis**. Which certainly sounds cooler.

* Ooops. They're called **Circles** now. Which I guess makes sense. Factions imply a tighter grouping, I guess.

* Ah! STATUS! PCs start with status one within their circle. This can rise during gameplay to show you going up in rank. 

  * I've always liked systems that play into that sort of thing. Sometimes handwaving just isn't enough.

  ### The City Hub

  * Looks like the City hub is it's own playbook. That's interesting. Sorta like DiMRPG's community playbook? (I *love* cross pollination of PbtA games.)
  * Each PC chooses an **Anchor** and a **Relationship** that's associated with the hub.
    * Anchors a vital NPCs, usually **Status 2**.
    * You start play with an Anchor owing you a Debt. Starting with a debt from a powerful NPC from the get go really means that you start the action quicker and deeper.
